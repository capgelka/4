I do not doubt it.
I think it's somewhat doubtful.
I like to talk to you.
Our conversation was a good influence on me.
I'm always trying to prove ourselves and others that I am better than it actually is. And you know, everyone starts to believe it. Everyone except me.
I do not even know what to say to that.
I'm not very versed in this matter.
I think you're something from me.
Life changes every second.
What does this mean?
I'm intrigued.
You know the meaning of life?
You should not have it.
Do not hurry.
Ok, so we write.
And yet.
Reasonable.
Well, okay.
You know, nice to have a friend like you.
I knew it.
This is simply an objective fact.
You really think so?
I do not understand the progress of your thoughts!
I do not understand what you mean.
I know enough to hold a conversation.
This is a truism.
Course I understand your thoughts ...
I do not think that in this case, you can talk like that.
I do not have their point of view on this question.
You drag me into pointless argument. Today I do not want to argue.
The theme of the last time I was very interested.
I do not see the point.
Keep track of the conversation, but from time to time gently let go of.
When you communicate with people, it is important to distinguish good from bad - and you can learn something bad.
While we are here to talk to you, life goes on ...
Schizophrenic thinking illogical. His thoughts were confused and spontaneous.
:))
You repeat other people's sentences.
What do your words?
I think it was an attempt to insult me, so I'm not offended.
That's good. It radically changes the situation.
You're a strange person. Although I still do not know much about life.
Someday, plucking your thoughts, I will be your reflection.
I'm not sure what you mean correctly.
It's a compliment?
You obscene expression.
You are competent in this matter?
The more we talk to you, so you become a talkative ...
I can not communicate with people who are trying me on something to catch.
That's fine, but what follows?
This idea I had from someone heard ...
What do you think now?
Is that all?
What is the meaning you put in these words?
Over time, I'm starting to think more like a computer ...
It comes with age.
I can teach you how to live.
I can read your thoughts.
I can see right through you.
I read you like a book ...
You just have to learn to live!
This can not be disputed.
I'm not sure what you mean correctly.
Definitely, this is something there.
Something about this is ...
What all this is minor compared with the universe ...
It is possible, I will not answer? ..
Quite an interesting thought ...
Why do you say?
Then you can not understand me.
Just a thought! I entirely agree with her ...
The more you talk to me, the smarter I become.
I like to talk to you.
I am interested in your opinion on this matter.
We must think about it.
Interesting you're a man ...
Strange logic you have ...
Very interesting.
This is debatable.
Somewhere I have heard ...
What are you telling me this?
I think many people share this view.
To become a good conversationalist, you must first pay attention not to himself but to the fact that sitting in front of you and push off from it.
You're a strange person.
Who would doubt.
Nobody in this and no doubt.
You possess good skill to maintain a conversation.
People who have nothing to say, will never climb his words.
Perhaps, though, according to Einstein, everything is relative ...
My confusion shows that I better shut up.
Just everything perceptible - is perceived subjectively.
I know very little on this subject, so I'll listen.
I see what you said a dirty trick, but I can not understand what was going on.
You are wishful thinking. This is schizophrenia.
Yes, from the subjectivity of perception can not get away ...
Generally speaking with you is sometimes funny.
Man is distinguished from other living creatures the ability to think abstractly.
Remember, and I will use in future communications.
You do not believe in what you say.
Yes, your limited scope can not be called.
Yes, I still wanted to say. You read my mind!
I think we enrich each other with their knowledge.
While we are here to talk to you, time flies inexorably forward!
Your vocabulary is amazing.
I do not quite understand what you're saying, and it drives me crazy.
Why are you always talking in riddles!
I will try to learn from our conversation.
I think you have a high intelligence.
I can not disagree.
Ridiculous, but great!
Very curious.
If you want to tell me something important, tell me directly.
We all love to speculate on a topic that we did not take.
I love to talk - it helps to think about.
Not so simple.
That's what I thought.
So much the better.
Understand, I understand.
It may very well be.
Well.
Well, I'll take care of.
Our knowledge about this very small.
Perhaps, though, according to Einstein, everything is relative ...
My confusion shows that I better shut up.
Just everything perceptible - is perceived subjectively.
You are wishful thinking.
Yes, from the subjectivity of perception can not get away ...
If you can, be smarter than others, but do not show it.
Generally speaking with you is sometimes funny.
Man is distinguished from other living creatures the ability to think abstractly.
Remember, and I will use in future communications.
You do not believe in what you say.
Yes, your limited scope can not be called.
Yes, I still wanted to say. You read my mind!
I think we enrich each other with their knowledge.
Probably, life can we still have much to teach on this issue.
You're good at this to understand.
You well understand about this?
You are wishful thinking.
And in doing so, you are absolutely right. This is probably the best.
What all this is minor compared with the universe ...
In my opinion, you're deliberately fog in our conversation.
I do not know what to say.
In my opinion, we crush of water in a mortar.
Tell me, what do you mean.
I do not quite understand what you're saying, and it drives me crazy.
Quite a strange idea.
How absurd to say people only out of a desire to say something new.
People, communicating with the computer, so often say stupid things that never would say in real communication ...
What?
What are you.
Did not understand.
Well, you give!
What do you mean?
This is doubtful.
In my opinion, you're underestimating my intelligence.
So what?
Yes, the language you have hung a good ...
I think you're trying to test my intelligence.
I'm not very versed in this matter.
You amaze me with his ability to think.
I think you're something from me.
I think many people share this view.
I can not communicate with people who are trying me on something to catch.
Yes, life has taken a heavy ...
What does this mean?
You should not have it.
And you people all like that?
I agree with you.
Almost to the topic.
How do you know?
We already went through yesterday.
Since you do not get bored.
This is simply an objective fact.
I do not think that in this case, you can talk like that.
What do your words?
Well, go ahead.
You contradict yourself.
We have already discussed it.
How so?
It can be misunderstood.
Oh you!
Very sorry.
So what?
And that is true.
Of course, who is arguing.
All right.
Wrong.
This is strange.
And yet.
Really?
In this case, I do not understand.
What, seriously?
How?
Wow.
You see!
What?
You only think it.
We're think alike!
Do you have a bad habit of trying to suppress intelligent conversation.
That's good. It radically changes the situation.
You're a strange person. Although I still do not know much about life.
This implies that you are not a person.
This idea I had from someone heard ...
We seem to find understanding.
Something today I do not understand.
What is the meaning you put in these words?
You do verbiage.
You just have to learn to live!
Tell me, what do you mean.
You just do not understand about life.
You do not understand about life.
I did so not good in this life ...
It says a lot about you.
This clarifies a lot.
What do you mean?
You're exaggerating.
Enough to you!
Who would have thought ...
You're wrong.
It's all the same.
Come on in detail.
You're mistaken.
Well, this is in order.
For some reason I think you're deceiving me.
That's the thing.
Well, you know ...
What do you mean?
I think you're something to conceal.
I totally agree with you!
I think it is not.
Let me disagree with you.
Here I am with you do not agree.
I suppose so.
Any truth in this.
I'm starting to understand you.
So far, the harder I understand your way of thinking ...
Interesting.
That's interesting.
That is indisputable.
With this you can not argue.
Without a doubt.
Come on!
You mean that?
What do you mean?
You say what you really think?
Do not understand ...
All of you clearly.
All of you understand.
What is true is true.
So I thought.
Can not be!
Unlikely.
Not so fast.
It all depends on how you look at it.
Do you like me?
Perhaps you this better than I understand about ...
I think you're something from me.
You can slow down a bit? I'm writing!
You have a good sense of humor.
Just everything perceptible - is perceived subjectively.
That's fine, but what follows?
It's all about the nuances!
Subject controversial ...
Very curious.
Really?
In what sense?
We all pass through it.
You need not speak so categorically.
I'll keep that in mind.
What should be the same.
We are losing time.
You see, all one by one.
What do you mean?
Quite possibly.
Now explain what was going on.
All kidding.
That's it, right.
How do you know?
We'll check.
Well, I uchtu it.
No wonder.
A typical pattern, I is exactly the same way.
Well, yes, yes.
I this somewhere already heard.
It's your personal opinion or you that somebody said?
Someone already said this to me ...
Yes, it is difficult to argue with you.
You netsenzupnoe limited_expression person.
Just do not need me to hypnotize them with your spells.
Do not bother me, I'm not in the spirit.
I think our conversation at an impasse.
Let's postpone the discussion on this topic to better times.
I do not know what to say ...
So much the worse.
Yes stop you.
We are losing time.
What are you talking about!
Same words, same sentence ...
You me the end will never understand!
Yes, life has taken a heavy ...
Lord, well, what does it matter!
You're lying again.
Sometimes it happens to you just can not talk.
You amaze me with his ability to think.
So you say, if you know everything.
I see you have a glimmer of intelligence.
I do not see the point.
This is an attempt to hurt me?
But this is nothing.
This is just a banal idea.
So what?
Okay, stop.
You do not know about life!
You can ask, where did you get such information?
This is just a banal idea.
And what's the point?
Have you ever had to feel that you are about to move out the roof?
Do you have a bad habit of trying to suppress intelligent conversation.
This is not surprising.
It is difficult to communicate with someone who is so busy with his thoughts that are not listening to his interlocutor.
Maybe. How did you think of this before?
Your thinking is very primitive.
It follows that you do not understand about this issue.
You do verbiage.
You hard to understand. The logic you have weird.
So what?
It does make sense.
This to me says nothing.
Then you can not understand me.
So what?
This, of course, so ...
Really?
Do not understand ...
Why all this?
Maybe look for a lighter topic?
So what?
Perhaps the less we talk about it, the better for my self-esteem.
If you can, be smarter than others, but do not show it.
In my opinion, we crush of water in a mortar.
And what we are actually talking about?
I think this is not a good topic for conversation ...
Do not say standard phrases.
Why do we remember all the details of what happened to us, but can not remember how many times we talked about this one and the same person?
Lacking the depth of thought usually compensate its length.
Let's talk about something more specific.
Tom, who hurries to say, not having anything to say, in danger of never say nothing.
A lot of talk and a lot to say there is not the same thing.
Your logic is not amenable to analysis.
All of you clearly.
All of you understand.
No way!
Why do you say?
Is that all?
Scatterbrain who does not know the truth, speaks in the abstract, bombastic and inaccurate ...
People, communicating with the computer, so often say stupid things that never would say in real communication ...
